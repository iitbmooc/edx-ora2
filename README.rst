Installation
============

The intent of this project is to be installed as Django apps that will be
included in `edx-platform <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform>`_.

To install all dependencies (assumes Ubuntu 12.04):

.. code:: bash

    make install


Running the Development Server
==============================

.. code:: bash

    ./scripts/workbench.sh

By default, the XBlock JavaScript will be combined and minified.  To
preserve indentation and line breaks in JavaScript source files:

.. code:: bash

    DEBUG_JS=1 ./scripts/workbench.sh

Additional arguments are passed to ``runserver``.  For example,
to start the server on port 8001:

.. code:: bash

    ./scripts/workbench.sh 8001


Running Tests
=============

To run all tests:

.. code:: bash

    make test

To limit Python tests to a particular module:

.. code:: bash

    ./scripts/test-python.sh openassessment/xblock/test/test_openassessment.py

To run just the JavaScript tests:

.. code:: bash

    ./scripts/test-js.sh

To run the JavaScript tests in Chrome so you can use the debugger:

.. code:: bash

    ./scripts/js-debugger.sh
